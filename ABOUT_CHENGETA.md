# CHENGETA - Financial Empowerment for Africa

## The Name "Chengeta"

**Chengeta** is a Shona word (Zimbabwe) meaning **"to protect" or "to take care of."** 

We chose this name because Chengeta is about protecting your financial future—taking care of your money so it can take care of you and your family.

## The Problem We're Solving

### Financial Literacy Crisis in Africa

**70% of Africans** are financially excluded or underserved. The average person:
- Has no budget or spending plan
- Lives paycheck to paycheck
- Cannot survive 30 days without income
- Lacks access to financial education
- Distrusts formal banking systems
- Falls victim to predatory lenders

### The Real Cost of Financial Illiteracy

| Impact | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| **Poverty Cycle** | Families remain trapped for generations |
| **Debt Spiral** | High-interest loans destroy wealth |
| **No Safety Net** | Medical emergencies become catastrophes |
| **Lost Opportunities** | No capital for education or business |
| **Economic Exclusion** | Unable to participate in wealth creation |

### Why Traditional Solutions Fail

1. **Banks** focus on the wealthy, ignore the masses
2. **Financial advisors** charge fees most can't afford
3. **Education** is in English, jargon-heavy, and Western-focused
4. **Apps** assume bank accounts and credit cards
5. **Content** doesn't reflect African realities

---

## Our Mission

> **"To democratize financial literacy and give every African the tools to build generational wealth."**

We believe financial freedom is a human right, not a privilege. Chengeta exists to bridge the gap between where people are and where they deserve to be financially.

---

## Our Vision

> **"An Africa where every person, regardless of income level, has the knowledge and tools to achieve financial independence."**

By 2030, we aim to:
- Educate **1 million Africans** on personal finance
- Help users collectively save **$100 million**
- Reduce financial stress for **500,000 families**
- Create **10,000 financially literate community leaders**
